## About

This is a list plugin, which has the functionality to allow the user to delete an item (hierarchy node) by linking the child nodes to the previous node of the deleted, for example:
- **A**
	
	- **B** 
		
		
		-  **C**

By excluding item "B", the link from "C" to "A" is established.

## Use

With the plugin properly installed in Joomla, we can use them in the list plugins, as shown in the image below:

- **Parent Column:** Choose the element (item/column) that will be deleted.
- **Recursively YES:** Responsible for deleting all sub-items from the selected item, that is, it does not link the nodes, it just deletes.
- **Recursively NO:** Responsible for changing the link after deleting the parent item as shown in the example above.
