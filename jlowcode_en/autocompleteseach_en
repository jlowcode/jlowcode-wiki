# Fabrik List Auto Complete Search <img src="../images/jlowcodelogo.png" width="102px" align="right" />

This implementation changes the already activated search box in a list, adding the autocomplete functionality that works from 2 or more letters. The functionality allows two ways to autocomplete, namely:

- From the elements that have been enabled to participate in the general search of the list.
- Based on recent or most frequent queries from users.

The options that appear are part of the configuration of the plugin that will be added.
- `Published`: defines if the plugin is published or not.
- `--do--*` : allows you to select the type of plugin you want, in this case the option "autocompletesearch" will be selected.
- `Description`: is an optional field to describe the functionality of the plugin, being very useful when there are several plugins of the same type.
